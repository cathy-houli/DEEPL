1.Evaluation of real datasets.
       we need an annotation of reference and sam file to be input files, and how many trans and exon covered by sam file results will be output.

	gcc -g -Wall -O0 -o STAT stat_read_trans.c -lz -lm -lpthread
	all result in sam file will be considered.
		./STAT a gtffile test.sam
                only best results of each reads in sam file will be considered.
		./STAT b gtffile test.sam
